# professional-portfolio

## Description

This project is the an ongoing professional portfolio. It was built as a central location to find some information about me and view my completed projects in one central location. This project really forced me to struggle through creating an HTML and CSS from scratch and learn more about the ins and outs of how they work and connect.
